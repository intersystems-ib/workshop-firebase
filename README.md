# Introduction

Firebase is a Google platform for the development of web applications, for this example we are going to create an adapter to connecto with Cloud Firestore, a NoSQL database available in Firebase.

# How to run the container?

Very easy! Just run the following command to start the IRIS instance:

```console
$ docker-compose up -d
```
# What are you going to find in this project?

* An IRIS Community installed and accesible from the [Management Portal](http://localhost:52774/csp/sys/UtilHome.csp) (user: superuser / password: sys).

* A production with a Business Service configured, this BS has a custom adapter configured to connect with a Cloud Firestore database using Embedded Python. There are two parameters to be configured:

	* KeyPath: with the path to the json file wich contains the key to access to your database
	* DocName: the name of the collection that you want to retrieve.
## Attention!
* To run this project you need a Firebase account and a project created with a Cloud Firestore database created to get a json file with the key to connect.
